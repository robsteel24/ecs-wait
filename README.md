# ECS Wait Action - Enhanced Version

This GitHub Action monitors ECS services for stability and waits until all specified services reach a stable state. It builds upon and enhances the original [ECS Wait Action](https://github.com/oryanmoshe/ecs-wait-action) created by [OryanMoshe](https://github.com/oryanmoshe).

## üöÄ Features
- **Retries on Failure**: Automatically retries monitoring ECS services up to a configurable number of attempts.
- **Verbose Logging**: Optional verbose logging for debugging ECS service stability issues.
- **Supports Multiple Services**: Monitors multiple ECS services simultaneously in a single cluster.
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: Improved error messages and support for invalid inputs.
- **AWS SDK v3**: Upgraded to AWS SDK v3 for better performance and modularity.
